[![Packaging status](https://repology.org/badge/vertical-allrepos/clight.svg)](https://repology.org/project/clight/versions)

Clight is a C user daemon utility that aims to fully manage your display.
It will automagically change screen backlight level to match ambient
brightness, as computed by capturing frames from webcam.
Moreover, it can manage your screen temperature, just like redshift does.
Finally, it can dim your screen after a timeout.

Clight is actually a control daemon which makes use of another daemon talking to the sensor inputs and hardware actuators, [Clightd](https://github.com/FedeDP/Clightd).
*Check the instructions there and [Clightd wiki](https://github.com/FedeDP/Clightd/wiki) for details regarding hardware configuration.*

It was heavily inspired by [calise](http://calise.sourceforge.net/wordpress/) in its initial intents.  

**For a guide on how to build, features and lots of other infos, head to [Clight Wiki Pages](https://github.com/FedeDP/Clight/wiki).**
